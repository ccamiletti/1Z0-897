Create a web service starting from a WSDL file using JAX-WS
we create the java class after that, we will create wsdl file with wsimport or wsgen.

If you start with an implementation bean class, use the wsgen command-line tool to generate all the web services provider artifacts, 
including a WSDL file if requested.

If you start with a WSDL file, use the wsimport command-line tool to generate all the web services artifacts for either the server or the client

wsimport = client
wsgen =  server
